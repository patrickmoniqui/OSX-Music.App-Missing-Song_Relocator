# OSX Music.App Missing Song Relocator
Music.app Missing Track Relinker is a hybrid Python + AppleScript tool that scans your Apple Music (formerly iTunes) library for missing tracks, and helps automatically relink them to the correct audio files based on metadata such as title, artist, album, year, and duration.
